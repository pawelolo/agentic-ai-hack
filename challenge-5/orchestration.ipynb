    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",

    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",

    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",

    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Relevant policy sections and quotes:\n",
      "- Section 1: Coverage Overview states: \"It covers damages and injuries you cause to others but does not cover damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself.\"\n",
      "- Section 2.1: Bodily Injury Liability lists the covered perils such as medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, rehabilitation, legal defense costs, and court-ordered judgments and settlements related to third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Based on the policy language, any claim involving liability to others would be covered as per the specific bodily injury and liability provisions. However, claims for damages to the insured's own vehicle or personal injuries are not covered. Therefore, credit approval depends on whether the claim falls within the covered liabilities to third parties per the defined policy coverage. If the claim involves damages or injuries caused to others, coverage is provided; if the claim seeks to recover own vehicle damage or self-injury costs, it will not be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "This precise policy content means claim approval must strictly align with liability to third parties, excluding any self or own vehicle claims„Äê3:0‚Ä†liability_only_policy.md„Äë.\n",

      "- The nature of the damage described aligns with the provided images and repair shop assessment.\n",
      "- Incident timing and location are plausible, with no unusual or suspicious delays in claim filing.\n",
      "- No indications of contradictory or exaggerated damage descriptions.\n",
      "- No evidence of repetitive or clustered claims involving this policyholder.\n",
      "- The inclusion of a police report and witness data further supports the authenticity.\n",

      "Claim Status: QUESTIONABLE\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim (ID: CL001) involves damage to a 2004 Honda Accord that was legally parked when a gray pickup truck struck its front and driver‚Äôs side. The incident happened on July 17, 2025, at a parking lot in Springfield, OH. The damage includes a dislodged front bumper, severe denting, wheel and tire damage on the driver's side, paint transfer, and potential hidden mechanical damage. Police involved and a witness supported the claim. The claimant is requesting full coverage of repair expenses minus deductible.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes photos of the vehicle damage, police report, repair shop estimate, and witness contact information, which are comprehensive and properly attached.\n",
      "- Damage Assessment and Cost Estimates: The damage is consistent with the collision described and the estimate from Springfield Auto Body appears aligned with typical costs for this type of damage (front bumper, quarter panel, wheel, and possible mechanical components).\n",
      "- Policy Verification: The policy documents for LIAB-AUTO-001 were not found in the system to verify coverage terms, limits, or deductibles.\n",
      "- Concerns: \n",
      "  1. Missing policy document prevents full validation of coverage eligibility.\n",
      "  2. The claim mentions ‚Äúfull coverage minus deductible‚Äù but deductible amount and policy limits unknown.\n",
      "  3. No direct statement or estimate value for repair costs was visible for assessment against industry standards.\n",
      "  4. A secondary crash under a different policy number was noted but unrelated to this claim; ensure no overlap or double claiming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve and review the full policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 to confirm coverage, exclusions, limits, and deductible.\n",
      "2. Obtain detailed repair cost estimates for comparison with industry standards.\n",
      "3. Validate that the claimant has not submitted overlapping claims under any other policies.\n",
      "4. If policy terms support the claim, recommend partial approval pending deductible application.\n",
      "5. Conduct final review once policy and cost data are confirmed to clear claim status.\n",
      "\n",
      "The claim is overall well-documented and plausible but cannot be fully approved until policy coverage and cost details are verified.\n",
